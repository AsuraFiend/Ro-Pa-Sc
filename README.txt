Rock-paper-scissor project is a part of a curriculum in Odin Project.
In this project, I created a common minigame to learn about the fundamentals of JavaScript.
They are  variables, variable scopes, boolean logic, conditional statements, how to create a function, how to call a function, and ectâ€¦

Rough estimation: 7-8 hours
